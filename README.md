# Hangman-Game 🎮🐍
This is a Python script of the classic game “Hangman”. The word to guess is represented by a random alphabet (A-Z). If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.  The player has 10 turns to guess the word, if fails to complete the word then you loose. It’s simple you can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
